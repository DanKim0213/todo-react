(Prerequisite: If you are looking for the official tutorial by MDN, see [Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks: React tutorials](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks#React_tutorials).)

I forked [todo-react](https://github.com/mdn/todo-react) to learn testing. The tests here are built on [Testing library](https://testing-library.com) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

This repository includes integration tests and unit tests:

```
Integration tests:
- ./test/App.*.test.js

Unit tests:
- ./src/**/*.test.js
```

To run the tests:

```bash
yarn & yarn test
```

To get this app running locally:

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```
